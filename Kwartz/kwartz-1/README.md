# Kwartz Model

Kwartz is an ensemble model that combines multiple machine learning models based on their accuracy. This project aims to provide a robust framework for model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Features

- **Model Ensemble**: Combines predictions from various models to improve accuracy.
- **Modular Design**: Each model is implemented as a separate class, making it easy to add or modify models.
- **Data Handling**: Includes preprocessing and data loading utilities.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides various metrics to evaluate model performance.
- **Training Management**: A dedicated trainer class to manage the training process and hyperparameter tuning.
